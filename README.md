# ember-cli-template-lint

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rwjblue/ember-cli-template-lint.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rwjblue/ember-cli-template-lint)

To install ember-cli-template-lint

```
ember install ember-cli-template-lint
```

Once installed, ember-cli-template-lint will add one test for each template
in an
application's codebase, and assert that all style rules are fulfilled. For example, given
the rule `bare-strings` is enabled, this template would be in violation:

```hbs
{{! app/components/my-thing/template.hbs }}
<div>A bare string</div>
```

Thus a the test `TemplateLint: app/components/my-thing/template.hbs` would
fail with the assertion "A bare string was found (0:5)".

This addon also allows you to move template compilation deprecations into browser
deprecations. This is useful if you would like to use the
`ember-cli-deprecation-workflow` addon or just to throw errors on template
compilation deprecations (via `EmberENV.RAISE_ON_DEPRECATE` flag).

Rules are enabled by default. You can turn off specific rules by toggling them in a
`.template-lintrc` file at the base of your project:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  'bare-strings': false
}
```

It is also possible to disable specific rules (or all rules) in a template itself:

```hbs
{{! disable all rules for this template }}
<!-- template-lint disable=true -->

{{! disable specific rules for this template }}
<!-- template-lint bare-strings=false -->
```

## Rules

Checkout the `ext/plugins/index.js` for a list of all rules.

## Contributing

A few ideas for where to take this in the future:

* The list of rules should be configurable
* This addon should use a test printer shared with jshint, eslint and jscs addons
* A command-line version of the linter should be provided so IDEs and editors
  can provide feedback to devs during development
